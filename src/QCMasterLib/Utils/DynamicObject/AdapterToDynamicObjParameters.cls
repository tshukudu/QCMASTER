/// SerializeArraysAsDynamicArrays class parameter setting.
/// Has two values:
/// $$$DynamicJSONArrayProjection (which corresponds to "jsonarray"):
/// 	Projects the array of collection as a dynamic array, doing this discards key <br>
/// 		related information, which does not form part of the output.<br>
/// 
/// 
/// $$$DynamicNativeProjection (which corresponds to "native"):
/// 	Projects the array of collection as a dynamic object, doing this projects the key <br>
/// 		values as property names of the output dynamic object with their values being the array<br>
/// 		elements.
